# RP-VAE

Random Projection integrated with minor changes to the vanilla vae code: https://github.com/kuc2477/pytorch-vae.
This code uses the vanilla VAE code as base so the same requirements and execution procedure hold for this code.

Instead of a single model.py file, the user can import a different parameterisation using the provided model_*.py file within main.py. (Model names are the same as those denoted in the paper)
